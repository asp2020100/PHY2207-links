<p>The experiment aims to verify the thermodynamic equation of state for a rubber band and measure the constant in this equation at constant temperature. The thermodynamic identity for a rubber band is given by dU=TdS+&tau;dL, where T is the temperature, &tau; is the tension, U is the internal energy of the rubber band, and S is its entropy[1]. The following discussion outlines the steps involved in the experiment:</p>
<p>1. Measure the tension of a rubber band as a function of temperature and length: Students can use a setup that involves measuring the force as a function of elongation at various fixed temperatures[2]. The elongations will be set by fixed length wires, and so will be the same for the various temperatures. In this way, students can also generate { f(T)L} curves[2].</p>
<p>2. Use Maxwell relations to measure changes in entropy and internal energy: Students can use a Maxwell relation to find the change in internal energy and entropy for an isothermal stretch[4]. This allows students to experimentally check the predictions of the entropic spring model for elastomers and observe that the entropy does indeed decrease as a rubber band is stretched[4].</p>
<p>3. Determine the nonideal contribution to the total force: Students can determine the nonideal contribution to the total force referenced to 30&deg;C for each elongation and tabulate these values[2].</p>
<p>4. Verify Hook's law for a rubber band: Students can verify Hook's law for a rubber band by measuring the force as a function of elongation at various fixed temperatures[3].</p>
<p>5. Measure the constant in the thermodynamic equation of state: Students can measure the constant in the thermodynamic equation of state by using equations (12) and (13) and assuming that the rubber is "ideal" (i.e., that = 0) [2]. Further simplification results from identifying with the "constant-length" heat capacity, CL[2].</p>
<p>In conclusion, the experiment involves measuring the tension of a rubber band as a function of temperature and length, using Maxwell relations to measure changes in entropy and internal energy, determining the nonideal contribution to the total force, verifying Hook's law for a rubber band, and measuring the constant in the thermodynamic equation of state. The experiment provides an opportunity for students to explore the thermodynamics of a rubber band and observe the unusual physical properties of elastomers[1][2][4].</p>
